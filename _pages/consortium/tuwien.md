Scientist in Charge: Michael Wimmer

The Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology, TU Wien, performs extensive fundamental and applied research in visual computing. Its areas of expertise in computer graphics are modelling and rendering, scientific visualisation, virtual environments, and computer animation. The research projects of the Rendering and Modeling Group focus on real-time graphics, point-based rendering, and procedural modelling. They have successfully developed and implemented a general-purpose VR and VE toolkit, the “Studierstube”, with exciting new and innovative features, as well as a complete Urban Modelling and Visualisation system capable of real-time walkthroughs in very complex environments. More recently, TUW developed a tool to visualize and interact with enormous 3D point clouds, called “Scanopy”, which is now frequently used by archaeologists for visualization, quality control and virtual anastylosis. 

Besides research projects, TUW specialises in consulting and technology transfer as well as in computer graphics-related education on both undergraduate and graduate level.
