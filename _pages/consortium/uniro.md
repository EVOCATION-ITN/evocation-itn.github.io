The University of Rostock is not only the oldest in the Baltic Sea area but also the richest in tradition. The Institute of Computer Science is part of the Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (IEF). IEF is very successful in obtaining extramural research funding. Recently, 3/5 DFG Research Training Groups at the University of Rostock were at IEF. In 2017, the new DFG Collaborative Research Center (SFB) ELAINE was established at IEF. University-wide, extramural research funding exceeds 50 million Euros annually.
