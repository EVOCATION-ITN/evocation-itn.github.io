Fraunhofer IGD (http://www.igd.fraunhofer.de) FhG – Fraunhofer Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.v.: Fraunhofer Institut für Graphische Datenverarbeitung (Fraunhofer IGD) was founded in 1987 and is lead by Professor Dr. techn. Dieter W. Fellner, since 2006. In addition to the headquarters in Darmstadt, the institute is present with branches in Rostock and Singapore. It has more than 200 full-time employees and 15 competence centres covering different aspects of computer graphics, computer vision, as well as virtual and augmented reality. The research and development projects of Fraunhofer are directly related to current requirements of market and economy. Numerous spin-offs ensure that prototypes are quickly brought to market.

Fraunhofer IGD’s **Competence Centre Cultural Heritage Digitization** is managed by Pedro Santos (director) and Martin Ritz (deputy director). It develops fast, economic digitization technologies for a faithful, virtual reproduction of real world objects, which enable an automated, accurate and physically correct reconstruction of their geometry, texture and optical material reflectance properties. The used reconstruction techniques digitize objects using a variety of sensors and light-sources under controlled environmental conditions for comparable results of the highest quality.

Fraunhofer IGD’s **Competence Centre 3D Printing Technology** was founded in 2013 and has five fulltime researchers as well as three student assistants. It focuses on multidisciplinary research in the field of colour science, spectral-based reproduction, quality assessment, psy chophysics as well as appearance modelling and processing for 2D-, 2.5D- and 3D printing.
