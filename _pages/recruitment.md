## Open PhD Positions

We are looking for **highly motivated candidates** for becoming the next generation of early-stage scientific and industrial researchers (ESRs) who in the future will lead research and development of novel visual and geometric computing methodologies in the widest variety of applications, including industrial design and manufacturing, cultural heritage study and valorisation, geomatics, and tele-collaboration.

We can offer you a **36-months PhD training program** coordinated among eight academic and industrial partners.

The host network includes prestigious institutions from accross Europe:

{% include feature_row id="row1" %}
{% include feature_row id="row2" %}
{% include feature_row id="row3" %}
{% include feature_row id="row4" %}
{% include feature_row id="row5" %}

## Benefits

**Training:** You will receive scientific skills in cutting-edge techniques focusing on translational science in expert laboratories, in a highly stimulating and collaborative environment. You will be involved in the particular project offered by the chosen hosting group. In addition, you will receive specialised courses involving business, OpenScience for OpenInnovation and entrepreneurship.  Transferable skills will be embedded throughout the project. There will be opportunities for short term secondments in collaborative laboratories within the network.

**PhD:** You will register in the Doctorate program in their host institution or associated University.
Salary: You will receive a highly competitive salary according to Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions rules. Exact salary will be calculated per country and will include living and mobility allowances.

**Hosting conditions:** Each recruited student will have a supervisory team to develop training and career plans.

## Elegibility Criteria

Each applicant must fulfil the following criteria at the time of recruitment:

1. The applicant must fulfil the requirements defined for Early Stage Researchers (ESRs)

2. ESRs are researchers who, at the time of recruitment are in the first 4 years (full-time equivalent) of his/her research career; and

3. have NOT yet been awarded the doctorate degree.

Date of recruitment normally means the first day of the employment of the fellow for the purpose of the project  (i.e. the starting date indicated in the employment contract).

You need to be flexible to travel throughout the Europe in order to exchange expertise between the partners of EVOCATION consortia and should be proficient in English.

Candidates will be interviewed by teleconference or called to interview soon after the application deadline.

## Employment Details

**Starting date:** Expected starting date is 1st April, 2019\\
**Contract duration:** 36 months\\
**Benefits and salary:** Successful candidates will receive a competitive salary and employment benefits in accordance with the MSCA regulations for early stage researchers and the host country, respectively.

**The exact salary will be confirmed upon appointment** and is dependent on a predetermined country correction factor, includes living allowance basic gross salary. An approximate guide to salary:

* Living allowance basic gross salary: approx. €3,2170 per month. This amount is adjusted through the application of a country correction coefficient to the living allowance of the country in which the researcher will be recruited.  Net salary results from deducting compulsory (employer/employee) social security contribution,as well as direct national and local taxes (e.g. income tax) from the gross amount.

* Mobility allowance: €600 per month

* Family allowance (if applicable): €500/month

* Additional funding for participation to courses, workshops, conferences, etc. is available.

You can find more details on the regulations in the [H2020 MSCA-ITN Guide for Applicants](/assets/documents/h2020-guide-appl-msca-itn_en.pdf).
