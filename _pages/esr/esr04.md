## Foveated rendering for large-high-resolution displays

### Objectives

In collaboration with UZH, the fellow will focus on developing adaptive acquisition and rendering methods for foveal Large High-Resolution Displays. Research questions will include new methods for dynamic camera and frustum selection, efficient data structures for foveal scene representations, and GPU-based RGB and RGB-D video stream processing.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications, research reports, prototype implementation of a shared telepresence visualization space.

### Host Institution

Supervisor: Prof. Oliver Staadt\\
University of Rostock, Chair in Visual Computing
