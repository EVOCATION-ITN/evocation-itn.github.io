## ESR04

### Objectives

In collaboration with TUW, the fellow will study modeling methods and interaction techniques for permitting exploration of high fidelity 3D models annotated with semantic (conceptual) information and with non-purely photorealistic representations. Researched topics will include information modeling, rendering methods, and user interfaces.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications, research reports and internal prototype implementation of exploration methods for annotated models. 

### Host Institution

Supervisor: Dr. Enrico Gobbetti\\
