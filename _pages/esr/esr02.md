title: "Real-time acquisition for collaborative telepresence on LHDs"
permalink: /recruitment/esr02/
---
## ESR02

### Objectives

Work work for this fellowship will be concerned with low-latency acquisition of RGB and RGB-D video streams to support a shared telepresence space for collaborative exploration of models created in EVOCATION. Research will include efficient algorithms for view-dependent 3D video reconstruction, low-latency compression for LHDs and 3D displays.

### Specific Requirements

The position requirese prior knowlede in computer graphics, computer vision, or visual computing. Hence, the background needs to be a M.Sc. in Computer Science or a closely related field. Skills in programming (C/C++, Matlab, OpenGL, OpenCV) are required.

### Host Institution

Supervisor: Prof. Oliver Staadt\\
[Chair in Visual Computing](https://vcg.informatik.uni-rostock.de)\\
Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering\\
University of Rostock\\
Germany
