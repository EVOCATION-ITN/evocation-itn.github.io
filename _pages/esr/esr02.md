## Real-time acquisition for collaborative telepresence on LHDs

### Objectives

Work will be concerned with low-latency acquisition of RGB and RGB-D video streams to support a shared telepresence space for collaborative
D6.3 exploration of models created in EVOCATION. Research will include efficient algorithms for view-dependent 3D video reconstruction, low-latency compression for LHDs and 3D displays.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications and prototype implementation of indoor capture and exploration systems.

### Host Institution

Supervisor: Prof. Oliver Staadt\\
University of Rostock, Chair in Visual Computing
