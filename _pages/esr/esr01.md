## ESR01

### Objectives

In collaboration with UZH, the fellow will focus on developing adaptive acquisition and rendering methods for foveal Large High-Resolution Displays. Research questions will include new methods for dynamic camera and frustum selection, efficient data structures for foveal scene representations, and GPU-based RGB and RGB-D video stream processing.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications, research reports, prototype implementation of a shared telepresence visualization space.

### Specific Requirements

The position requirese prior knowlede in computer graphics, computer vision, or visual computing. Hence, the background needs to be a M.Sc. in Computer Science or a closely related field. Skills in programming (C/C++, Matlab, OpenGL, OpenCV) are required.

### Host Institution

Supervisor: Prof. Oliver Staadt\\
[Chair in Visual Computing](https://vcg.informatik.uni-rostock.de)\\
Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering\\
University of Rostock\\
Germany
