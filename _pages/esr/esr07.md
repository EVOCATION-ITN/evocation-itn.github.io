## ESR07

### Objectives
 
 Work on acquisition and processing of multimodal data coming from different sources characterized by strong differences in data density, noise and level of detail. Data integration is a strong challenge, since most state-of-the-art approaches cannot be applied. The candidate will focus on automatic alignment and merging of different input (considering both shape-related and reflection-related data).  Flexible and easy to use methodologies for the acquisition of surface appearance will be devised. The proposed methods should be applied to real problems, with target areas Security/Monitoring and Cultural Heritage (including the use of UAVs).

### Expected Results

Scientific publications and prototype implementation of methods for multimodal acquisition of geometry and reflectance.
