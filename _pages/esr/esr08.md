title: "Geometry processing for 3D fabrication"
permalink: /recruitment/esr08/

## ESR08

### Objectives

Work on geometry-related problems in fabrication. The first objective is to create a framework that uses geometry analysis to extend 3D printing technology to a wider scale, for example automatizing manual processes used in the industry (such as the operations required for mold creation). Secondarily, the fellow will push the limit of the 3D printing technology creating novel and unexpected applications in material design.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications and prototype implementation of methods for geometry processing for fabrication.

### Host Institution

Supervised by R. Scopigno and P. Cignoni\\
CNR-ISTI\\
Pisa, Italy

### PhD Granting Institution
