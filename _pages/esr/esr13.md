## ESR13

### Objectives

In collaboration with UNIRO, the fellow will go beyond the current state of applicability by way of the integration and distributed parallel implementation of industry standard scene-graph and real-time ray-tracing based rendering concepts, which were not originally designed for distributed concurrent rendering. Research questions will include how to improve throughput of such a system and how to apply, adapt and invent existing and novel rendering techniques for light field displays on GPU clusters.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications, research reports, prototype implementation of an advanced light field rendering engine.

### Specific Requirements

The position requires prior knowledge in computer graphics. Hence, the background needs to be an M.Sc. in Computer Science or a closely related field. Skills in programming (C/C++ with MSVC and GCC toolsets, OpenGL or Direct3D, OpenCL or Cuda) are required. Proficiency with Linux operating systems and GPU clusters is an advantage.
