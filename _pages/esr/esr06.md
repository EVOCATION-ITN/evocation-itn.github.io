## ESR06

### Objectives

In collaboration with UNIRO, the fellow will study techniques for large-scale visualization and load balanced parallel rendering, supporting the interactive visualization of large scale and complex 3D data, targeting 3D displays as well as pixel-intensive displays. Issues of large scale data-parallel interactive ray-tracing may be investigated.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications, research reports and proof-of-concept prototype implementations of scalable parallel graphics and rendering methods. Completion of PhD program including a dissertation on these topics and participation in teaching and other graduate program activities.

### Specific Requirements

The position requires prior knowledge in computer graphics, computer vision, or visual computing. Hence, the background needs to be a M.Sc. in Computer Science or a closely related field. Skills in programming (C/C++, Python, Matlab, OpenGL, OpenCV) are required.

### Host Institution

Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Renato Pajarola\\
Head [Visualization and MultiMedia Lab](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/vmml/)\\
University of ZÃ¼rich\\
Switzerland
