## ESR12

### Objectives

The ESR will simulate color and subsurface light transport of any voxel-based arrangement of printing materials – for which the absorption and scattering coefficients have been measured beforehand – using a Monte-Carlo path tracer (e.g. Mitsuba) that solves the full steady-state Radiative Transfer Equation. He will use these simulations to develop a voxel-based 3D error-diffusion algorithm for reproducing color and subsurface light transport by utilizing color-related redundancies of the multimaterial 3D printer. In addition, s/he will work on extended gamut mapping algorithms to exploit the full capabilities of a 3D printer allowing for both color and translucency. Finally, the ESR will implement error-diffusion and gamut-mapping algorithms and include them into the 3D printing pipeline Cuttlefish.

### Expected Results

Prototype implementation and published papers on new error-diffusion and gamut mapping algorithms for 3D printing.
