## ESR11

### Objectives

Work on a standardized format for optical material properties, as an optional subset of a future consolidated 3D model format. Material properties data will be provided by different sources, e.g., CultLab3D. Contribution to development of optical material properties acquisition methods on large objects by identifying regions of interest and extrapolating class-based samples to various regions of similar class on the same object. Implementation of technologies for visualization of optical material properties over the web, fully supporting WEB3D/X3DOM and the standardized format to be developed using native graphics acceleration capabilities of individual end user devices.

### Expected Results

Research reports and prototype implementation and published papers on optical material properties acquisition methods. Identification of suitable standardization bodies for the establishment of standardized consolidated 3D model format.
