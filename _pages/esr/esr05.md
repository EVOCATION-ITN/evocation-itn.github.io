## ESR05

### Objectives

In collaboration with GEXCEL and CRS4, the fellow will study scalable geometry processing and 3D reconstruction techniques in particular for man-made interior environments and with respect to scan-to-BIM approaches. Geometry processing issues related to linking capture to fabrication may also be investigated.

### Expected Results

Scientific publications, research reports and proof-of-concept implementations of methods for complex 3D shape fitting and semantic 3D structure analysis. Completion of PhD program including a dissertation on these topics and participation in teaching and other graduate program activities.

### Specific Requirements

The position requires prior knowledge in computer graphics, computer vision, or visual computing. Hence, the background needs to be a M.Sc. in Computer Science or a closely related field. Skills in programming (C/C++, Python, Matlab, OpenGL, OpenCV) are required.

### Host Institution

Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Renato Pajarola\\
Head [Visualization and MultiMedia Lab](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/vmml/)\\
University of ZÃ¼rich\\
Switzerland
