abstract = {We propose a novel technique for the automatic design of molds to cast highly complex shapes. The technique generates composite, two-piece molds. Each mold piece is made up of a hard plastic shell and a flexible silicone part. Thanks to the thin, soft, and smartly shaped silicone part, which is kept in place by a hard plastic shell, we can cast objects of unprecedented complexity. An innovative algorithm based on a volumetric analysis defines the layout of the internal cuts in the silicone mold part. Our approach can robustly handle thin protruding features and intertwined topologies that have caused previous methods to fail. We compare our results with state of the art techniques, and we demonstrate the casting of shapes with extremely complex geometry.},

    abstract = { Creating high-level structured 3D models of real-world indoor scenes from captured data is a fundamental task which has important applications in many fields. Given the complexity and variability of interior environments and the need to cope with noisy and partial captured data, many open research problems remain, despite the substantial progress made in the past decade. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date integrative view of the field, bridging complementary views coming from computer graphics and computer vision. After providing a characterization of input sources, we define the structure of output models and the priors exploited to bridge the gap between imperfect sources and desired output. We then identify and discuss the main components of a structured reconstruction pipeline, and review how they are combined in scalable solutions working at the building level. We finally point out relevant research issues and analyze research trends. },

abstract="We introduce a novel end-to-end approach to predict a 3D room layout from a single panoramic image. Compared to recent state-of-the-art works, our method is not limited to Manhattan World environments, and can reconstruct rooms bounded by vertical walls that do not form right angles or are curved -- i.e., Atlanta World models. In our approach, we project the original gravity-aligned panoramic image on two horizontal planes, one above and one below the camera. This representation encodes all the information needed to recover the Atlanta World 3D bounding surfaces of the room in the form of a 2D room footprint on the floor plan and a room height. To predict the 3D layout, we propose an encoder-decoder neural network architecture, leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture long-range geometric patterns, and exploiting a customized training strategy based on domain-specific knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in prediction accuracy, in particular in cases of complex wall layouts or curved wall footprints.",

Our technique focuses on minimizing the surface affected by supports, decomposing the object into multiple parts whose printing orientation is automatically chosen. The segmentation reduces the visual impact on the fabricated model producing non-planar cuts that adapt to the object shape. This is performed by solving an optimization problem that balances the effects of supports and cuts, while trying to place both in occluded regions of the object surface. To assess the practical impact of the solution, we show a number of segmented, 3D printed and reassembled objects.},

@article{Laccone:2020,
	Abstract = {Bending-active structures are able to efficiently produce complex curved shapes from flat panels. The desired deformation of the panels derives from the proper selection of their elastic properties. Optimized panels, called FlexMaps, are designed such that, once they are bent and assembled, the resulting static equilibrium configuration matches a desired input 3D shape. The FlexMaps elastic properties are controlled by locally varying spiraling geometric mesostructures, which are optimized in size and shape to match specific bending requests, namely the global curvature of the target shape. The design pipeline starts from a quad mesh representing the input 3D shape, which defines the edge size and the total amount of spirals: every quad will embed one spiral. Then, an optimization algorithm tunes the geometry of the spirals by using a simplified pre-computed rod model. This rod model is derived from a non-linear regression algorithm which approximates the non-linear behavior of solid FEM spiral models subject to hundreds of load combinations. This innovative pipeline has been applied to the project of a lightweight plywood pavilion named FlexMaps Pavilion, which is a single-layer piecewise twisted arch that fits a bounding box of 3.90x3.96x3.25 meters. This case study serves to test the applicability of this methodology at the architectural scale. The structure is validated via FE analyses and the fabrication of the full scale prototype.},

By exploiting the human visual system’s limitations, in particular in terms of reduced acuity in peripheral vision, it strives to deliver high-quality visual experiences at very reduced computational, storage, and transmission costs. Despite the very substantial progress made in the past decades, the solution landscape is still fragmented, and several research problems remain open. In this work, we present an up-to-date integrative view of the domain from the point of view of the rendering methods employed, discussing general characteristics, commonalities, differences, advantages, and limitations. We cover, in particular, techniques based on adaptive resolution, geometric simplification, shading simplification, chromatic degradation, as well spatio-temporal deterioration. Next, we review the main areas where foveated rendering is already in use today. We finally point out relevant research issues and analyze research trends.}

abstract = {The computational fabrication community is developing an increasing interest in the use of patterned surfaces, which can be designed to show ornamental and unconventional aesthetics or to perform as a proper structural material with a wide range of features. Geometrically designing and controlling the deformation capabilities of these patterns in response to external stimuli is a complex task due to the large number of variables involved. This paper introduces a method for generating sets of tileable and exchangeable flat patterns as well as a model-reduction strategy that enables their mechanical simulation at interactive rates. This method is included in a design pipeline that aims to turn any general flat surface into a pattern tessellation, which is able to deform under a given loading scenario. To validate our approach, we apply it to different contexts, including real-scale 3D printed specimens, for which we compare our results with the ones provided by a ground-truth solver.}

abstract = {A high prediction accuracy of optical printer models is a prerequisite for accurately reproducing visual attributes (color, gloss, translucency) in multimaterial 3D printing. Recently, deep-learning-based models have been proposed, requiring only a moderate number of printed and measured training samples to reach a very high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we present a multi-printer deep learning (MPDL) framework that further improves data efficiency utilizing supporting data from other printers. Experiments on eight multi-material 3D printers demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly reduce the number of training samples thus the overall printing and measurement efforts. This makes it economically feasible to frequently characterize 3D printers to achieve a high optical reproduction accuracy consistent across different printers and over time, which is crucial for color- and translucency-critical applications.},
