The second workshop of EVOCATION was held online on 18-19 March, 2021 due to COVID-19. Due to the global travel restrictions, our scheduled workshop could not be arranged in the originally planned location in Zürich (Switzerland). Hence the workshop was held online where all of our currently recruited ESRs, project leaders and management personnel participated. There were a total of 26 participants in the workshop.

After that, the ESRs presented their updates which included their current work updates, results from current research and their corresponding plans for the rest of the project timeline.
