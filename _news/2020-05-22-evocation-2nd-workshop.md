The second workshop of EVOCATION was help online on 21-22 May, 2020 due to COVID-19. Due to the global travel restriction, we were not able to arrange our scheduled workshoptook in Darmstadt (Germany); hence we arranged the workshop online where all of our currently recruited ESRs, project leaders, management personnel and quite a few external participants participated. There were a total of 35 participants in the workshop.
