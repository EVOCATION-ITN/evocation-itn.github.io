The second summer school of EVOCATION was help online on 01-02 October, 2020 due to COVID-19. Due to the global travel restrictions, our scheduled summer school could not be arranged in the originally planned location in Cagliari and hosted by CRS4. Hence the summer school was held online where all of our currently recruited ESRs, project leaders, management personnel, and quite a few external speakers and participants toom part. There were a total of 66 participants in the summer school.

The summer school program covered two entire days, and has been organized around two tracks. In the morning, the lectures were focused on technical/scientific topics offering a wide coverage of the visual computing field including AI, efficient GPU data structures, automatic 3D reconstruction process, rapid prototyping of geometric processing pipelines and so on. 

In the afternoon, the lectures were, instead, dedicated to additional skills, with lectures on IPR, FAIR data management, and Productivity, Project and Time Management for Scientists. All lectures were given by well known experts, distributed around the world. 

In addition to EVOCATION participants, the talks were opened to selected attendants from participating institutions. A total of 66 participants from 14 institutions attended the school, including all the currently recruited ESRs enrolled in the project. 

Each talk was followed by a lively discussion session involving speakers, PIs, and ESRs.

Most of the participants stayed together in a hotel in the downtown of Vienna that was easily connected with the event venue. In the evenings, they participated in social activities to encourage bonding as a team and the development of personal relationships with the newcomers.
