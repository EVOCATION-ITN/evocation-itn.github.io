The summer school program covered two entire days, and has been organized around two tracks. In the morning, the lectures were focused on technical/scientific topics offering a wide coverage of the visual computing field including AI, efficient GPU data structures, automatic 3D reconstruction process, rapid prototyping of geometric processing pipelines and so on.
